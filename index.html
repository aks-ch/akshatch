                    This was my first solo game dev project that I consider completed. As the name and picture suggests, it is a very simple, 2d maze game. You can choose the dimensions of the maze within the defined limits and the game will generate a random maze of those dimensions. The maze in the image above is of dimensions 8x8.

                    There were two key aspects of the game that were quite the roadblocks during the development process for me.<br />
                    The first problem was implementing a way to link my maze generation algorithm to the actual maze. I assigned a node to each visual box in the maze, physically separating each box. Each node has 4 walls for all sides. As the generation algorithm runs, it moves from node to node on each step removing the two walls connecting the two nodes on the current step. This also allowed me to add an option to show the maze generating by throttling the execution speed of the algorithm.<br />
                    The second problem was implementing a completely unnecessary feature, the maze generation animation. Throttling the speed of the algorithm wasn't enough for me, I wanted to show the nodes generating... in a spiraling way... Yeah, that wasn't possible given how the algorithm was written utlizing nodes aligned in a single dimension array for the code. A little bit of tinkering around and using division of all things to access nodes visually next to each other, I figured it out!

                    It may have taken me only about a week to complete the game, but it was a difficult and fun challenge for me. Before this project, I was only good at programming. I couldn't even think about touching digital design. This project was quite the confidence builder. It further familiarized me with Unity and its tools. It built the foundation of C# for me (I only had basic knowledge of the language prior to this project). And most importantly, I learnt how I can use my development skills for designing.
